# Solutions to Assignment 1 (NLProc-PGM4NLP-M)

## Part 1 - Independence

### a) Two random variables are independent

Two dice throws are independent from each other.

### b) Two random variables are causally linked

The probability that a person has COVID and the probability that the COVID-Test for the same person is positive (having COVID causes the positive Test).

### c) Two random variables that are causally linked but independent

### d) Three random variables that are not pairwise independent but conditionally independent

The probability that a satellite looses power, that it falls apart and that it is hit by a (large and/or high energy) object.


### e)

### f) A random variable that is independent from itself

A coin toss is independent from itself. P("heads" ^ "heads") == P("heads") * P("heads")

## Part 2 - Programming

see `index.ts` (and partially `s.ts`) for the solutions. To run them, the node runtime is needed. Install dependencies (TypeScript) via `yarn`, then run `yarn tsx index.ts` to execute.
